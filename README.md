# webgl-experiment
A playground for learning WebGl.

Been following this [MDN tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API/Tutorial) to learn the basics of WebGL.
Thanks to Martin TÃ¶rnqvist([@hassanbot](https://github.com/hassanbot)) for teaching me about Quats, necessary for the cubes to rotate around themselves. 

Font used is the amazing [Manrope](https://manropefont.com/).
